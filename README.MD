Expected Output:







Specs //
Helper Specs
// it will identify a vowel (helper?)
// it will recognize punctuation/symbols/spaces/numbers and exclude them (helper?)
// it will ignore capitalization

Branching Process

General Case
// it will check the first letter (use an if statement)

// write a function that pulls other peoples code off github and reposts it as my own




Edge Case
// it will move consecutive "q" and "u" to the end of a word and add "ay" (qu counts as a consonant)

Starts with Vowel
// it will add way to the end of a word starting with a vowel (first character is a vowel)

Starts with Consonant
// it will move consonants + "ay" to the end of a word until it encounters a vowel



**/// Benten and Paigemaster

// function should:
// output "way" at the end of a word //
// output "way" at the end of a word once //
// output "way" at the end of a word beginning with a vowel
// output "way" at the end of all words beginning with a vowel
// not output "way" at the end of a word beginning with a consonant//
// remove the first consonant to the end of a word with only one consonant 
// add the first consonant to the end of a word with only one consonant
// move the first consonants to the end of a word with multiple consonants
// add ay after moving consonants
// count y as a consonant, not a vowel
// move q and u together as "qu" and add way
// do this regardless of capitalization
// stretch goal: ignore punctuation
